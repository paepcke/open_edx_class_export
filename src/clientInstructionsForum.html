<h2>Forum Table</h2>
The forum table contains all the forum posts of one course. This table
is only meaningful for courses that used the forum that is built into
the OpenEdX platform. If the course of interest used a different forum
facility then this table is not what you want.  The individual columns
are explained on <a href="http://datastage.stanford.edu/#appB" target="_blank"> our how-to page</a>.
<p>
There are two types of forum table exports: <i>relatable</i>
and <i>isolated</i>. The difference lies in the coding scheme used to
anonymize the screen names of forum posters. In relatable forum
exports the coding scheme is identical to the one used in other course
data tables. It is thereby possible to compute correlations between
forum post behavior and other data about the same course participant.
<p>
In contrast, isolated forum exports use an entirely different scheme
for encoding screen names. Computation of correlations with other data
by the same course participant is therefore not possible with isolated
forum exports. However, isolated exports somewhat better protect
privacy, and are therefore preferred.
<p>
In all cases an effort is made in each forum post to automatically
redact occurrences of phone numbers, email addresses, zip codes, and
the poster's screen name. Word count is preserved with these
redactions. The redacted word is replaced with a token that identifies
the type of information that was elided. This process is not at all
perfect. Strict discretion is required of researchers when person
names are gleaned in forum data.
