Once at that page, download the three .csv files there. Your username

The main table file will include 'EventXtract' in its name. Each
of its rows contains one 'event,' a student's interaction with
the OpenEdX learning platform. The table file that includes the term
'VideoInteraction' excerpts rows from the EventXtract table 
that are video related. This table is convenient for when you are
particularly interested in video.

Rows in the table file that contains the name 'ActivityGrade' excerpts 
all the assignment related rows from EventXtract, but adds additional
assignment related information.
