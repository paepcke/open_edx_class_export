<h2 style="padding: 5px; margin: 0px;">Time on Task Tables</h2>

The three tables obtained from the <i>time-on-task</i> choice are
'engagement_..._allData.csv,' 'engagement_..._summary.csv,' and
engagement_..._weeklyEffort.csv.' The allData table can be large. For
each participant the table contains one row per interaction 'session.' A
session is a series of actions the respective participant undertook on
the platform, with no more than 30 minutes of inactivity between any
two actions. 

The summary table normally contains just a single line. The line shows
the total number of sessions in the class, total number of minutes
spent across all participants throughout the class, and counts for various
session length medians. 

The weeklyEffort table shows for each participant the median number of
(observable) minutes spent on the course during each week.
