<h2 style="padding: 5px; margin: 0px;">Basic Tables</h2>
The main table file of the <i>basic</i> type export will include
'EventXtract' in its name. Each of its rows contains one 'event,' a
class participant's interaction with the OpenEdX learning
platform. This table can be very large, potentially more than 1M rows.

The table file that includes the term 'VideoInteraction' excerpts rows
from the EventXtract table that are video related. This table is
convenient for when you are particularly interested in video. The rows
still reflect individual participant interactions; they are not
aggregated. 

Rows in the table file that contains the name 'ActivityGrade' excerpts 
all the assignment related rows from EventXtract, but adds additional
assignment related information.
