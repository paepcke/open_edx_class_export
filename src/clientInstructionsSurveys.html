<h2>Pre- and post-course surveys<h2>
The course survey export consists of three tables: Survey, Response, and ResponseMetadata.
Survey contains information about the structure of the survey, including question text, question numbers,
and choices for each question. Response contains learner responses to each question. ResponseMetadata
contains information that can be used to link a learner's survey responses to their behavior in
the course.
