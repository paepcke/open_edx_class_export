# Optionally, a MySQL regex pattern can be provided, which
# filters the course names. Source of the result is table
# student_courseenrollment.
#
# Independently of this regex pattern, the script tries to filter out
# course names that are clearly just tests, or course name
# misspellings that pollute the log files. Part of this filtering is
# that only courses with enrollment numbers greater than
# $MIN_ENROLLMENT.
#
# This script may be used from the command line. It is also used
# by exportClass.py in open_edx_class_export.
