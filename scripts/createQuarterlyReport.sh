# Outputs all course_display_name(s) and their respective
# enrollment, plus number of awarded certificates,
# ratio of certsAwarded to enrollment, and whether the course is
# Stanford-internal or not. The amount of information is controlled
# by CLI switches.
# Output sample:
#
#    Medicine/HRP214/Winter2014
#    Medicine/HRP214/Winter2014,26415
#    Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,26415,500,0.0189,no
#
# Optionally, a MySQL regex pattern can be provided, which
# filters the course names.
#
# Beyond the regex pattern, course names to include in the output 
# may be from one of two sources, depending on the presence of
# the --byActivity option: if that option is provided the script includes 
# courses that show any activity during the requested quarter(s)
# and academic year. This option takes a little over 2 minutes,
# and will include more courses, b/c course material is accessed
# beyond course end dates.
# When the --byActivity option is absent, course names that ran during the 
# requested quarter(s)/year(s) are taken from table CourseInfo,
# which is constructed from the OpenEdX modulestore. This case
# is fast (about 2sec).
#
# Also controlled by a CLI is the minimum number of enrollments
# a course must have to be included in the output: -m/--minEnrollment.
# Default is 9.
#
# Independently of the course name regex pattern and the enrollment
# minimum, the script tries to filter out
# course names that are clearly just tests, or course name
# misspellings that pollute the log files. This filter is always
# applied. 
#
# This script may be used from the command line. It is also used
# by exportClass.py in open_edx_class_export.
